# Queries

I've got a query for ya. How fast does this baby go?

## Defining queries

Data in Triplit is organized into collections, so to define a query you must first specify which collection you want to query.

For example, if you want to query the `users` collection, you would do the following:

```typescript
const query = client.query('users');
```

  Relationships and joins are not yet supported in Triplit, but are on the
  [roadmap](/roadmap).

## Selecting fields

To specify which fields you want to return, you can use the `select` method. This method accepts a list of field names as arguments.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob']);
```

## Filtering

To filter results based on conditions, you can use the `where` method. This method accepts a list of clauses as arguments. A clause is a tuple that takes the form `[field, operator, value]`.

For example the following query will return all registered users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where([[['is_registered', '=', true]]]);
```

By default all clauses are joined with a logical AND, but you may use `or` and `and` methods within the clause array to specify how clauses should be logically grouped and joined.

For example the following query will return all registered users who are either an admin or an owner.

```typescript
import { or } from '@triplit/client';

const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where([
    [
      ['is_registered', '=', true],
      or([
        ['role', '=', 'admin'],
        ['role', '=', 'owner'],
      ]),
    ],
  ]);
```

### Operators

Triplit currently supports `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `like` and `nlike` operators in `where` statements.

You can use the `like` operator in a where clause to do simple filtering with string similarity. A `like` expression is true if the supplied field matches the supplied filter pattern.

An underscore (`_`) in a pattern stands for (matches) any single character; a percent sign (`%`) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

For example:

```typescript
['triplit', 'like', 'triplit']    true
['triplit', 'like', 'tri%']       true
['triplit', 'like', 'tr_pl_t']    true
['triplit', 'like', 'trip']       false
```

## Order

To order the results of a query, you can use the `order` method. This method accepts a single order clause as arguments. A clause is a tuple that takes the form `[field, direction]`.

For example the following query will return all users ordered by their creation date in descending order.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .order(['created_at', 'DESC']);
```

  Ordering by multiple fields is not supported by Triplit, but is on the
  [roadmap](/roadmap).

## Limit

Many times you will want to limit the number of results returned by a query. To do this, you can use the `limit` method.

For example, the following query will return the 10 most recently created users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .order(['created_at', 'DESC'])
  .limit(10);
```

## Sync state

Triplit's client [storage](/docs/storage) is split into two areas - an outbox for unsynced updates and a cache for synced updates. Sometimes you may want to indicate that to a user that data has not yet been saved to the server. To do this, you can use the `syncStatus` method. This method accepts a single sync state (`pending`, `confirmed`, `all`) as an argument.

For example, a messaging app could use two queries to build message sent indicators. In [React](/docs/getting-started#react):

```tsx
const allMessagesQuery = client.query('messages').order(['createdAt', 'ASC']);

const pendingMessagesQuery = client
  .query('messages')
  .select(['id'])
  .syncStatus('pending');

function Messages() {
  const { results: allMessages } = useQuery(client, allMessagesQuery);
  const { results: pendingMessages } = useQuery(client, pendingMessagesQuery);

  return (
    <div>
      {allMessages.entries().map(([id, message]) => (
        <div>
          <p>{message.text}</p>
          <p>{pendingMessages.has(id) ? 'Sending...' : 'Sent'}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
