# Storage

That's a lot of trunk space!

## Overview

Triplit keeps your data in two storage areas, an 'outbox' and a 'cache'. The outbox is a queue of data that is waiting to be sent to the server. The cache is a local copy of the data that has been sent to the server.

If you are offline or do not have syncing enabled, then the data will remain in the outbox so you can sync that data at a later time should you decide to.

## MemoryStorage

If you would only like to store data ephemerally, you can use the memory storage engine. This will store your data in memory and will not persist across page refreshes.

If you use memory storage for your outbox, data may be lost if the user refreshes the page before the data is sent to the server.

If no storage options are provided this is the default.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient, MemoryStorage } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  db: {
    storage: {
      outbox: new MemoryStorage(),
      cache: new MemoryStorage(),
    },
  },
});
```

## IndexedDBStorage

If you would like to persist data between refreshes in the browser you can use the IndexedDB storage engine. This will store your data in the browser's IndexedDB database.

To improve performance, data is also cached in memory.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient, IndexedDBStorage } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  db: {
    storage: {
      outbox: new IndexedDBStorage('my-app-outbox'),
      cache: new IndexedDBStorage('my-app-cache'),
    },
  },
});
```
