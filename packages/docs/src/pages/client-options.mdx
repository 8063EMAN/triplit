# Client Options

## DB options

These options define your local cache.

- `migrations` is a list of migrations to run on the local cache (which will define a schema, see [Schema](/schema))
- `schema` is a hard coded schema for your local cache
- `storage` determines the storage engines for your local cache (see [Storage](/storage))

## Sync options

These options define how you want to sync with the server.

- `server` is the host of the server where your project lives
- `apiKey` is the API key for your project

These options can be updated by passing options to `client.updateSyncOptions`.

## Auth options

These options define how you authenticate with your client database and remote database.

- `token` is a jwt that is used to identify the user to the client database and remote databases (see the [Auth guide](/guides/auth)). Providing a `token` will set the variable `$SESSION_USER_ID` on the database, which is used for authorization rules. Providing a `token` will also override the `sync.apiKey` option.
- `claimsPath` is the path to the Triplit claims on the token. It should be a `.` separated string like `path.to.claims`. This should match the value set on your project in the Triplit Dashboard.

These options can be updated by passing options to `client.updateAuthOptions`.
