# Getting Started

Let's get you out of park and put you in first gear. Are you pressing the clutch?

## Installation

Inside your project directory, install the Triplit client package `@triplit/client`:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>

  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm i @triplit/client
    ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @triplit/client
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @triplit/client
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up your client

A Triplit client instance will set up a local cache for your data and (if turned on) will set up the required network connections for syncing. The specifics of your local cache and syncing can be configured by passing in options to the client, which are described in the [client options reference](/client-options). For now we will not pass in any options, which will set up an in-memory local cache with no schema and no syncing.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient();
```

Triplit organizes your data into collections, which are like tables in a relational database. You create query on a collection by calling `client.query()` and appending data to select and filters. Along with one-off queries, you can subscribe to incremental changes to a query.

```typescript
const completeTodoIdsQuery = client
  .query('todos')
  .select(['id'])
  .where([[['completed'], '=', true]]);

// One-off query
const completeTodoIds = client.fetch(completeTodoIdsQuery);

// Subscription
const unsubscribe = client.subscribe(completeTodoIdsQuery, (data) => {
  // do something with data
});
```

## Framework support

If you are using a framework like React, Vue (coming soon), or Svelte (coming soon), you can use the Triplit framework bindings to make it easier to work with Triplit in your framework. See [frameworks](/frameworks) for more information.
